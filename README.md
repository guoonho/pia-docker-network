# homebox

A collection of server applications that I use, all neatly packed into a docker-compose file. This allows me to quickly provision my entire setup on any server that can support docker. 

### Hardware/Software Setup

At the moment, I have this setup running on a Ubuntu VM running on my gaming desktop, however the future plan is to host this on a separate machine. For now however, this works.

Software wise, the stack looks something like this:

```
Linux
└── Docker
    └── homebox
```

Hardware wise, any old working PC will do. I suggest using an SSD (a budget one will do) for the actual operating system, and regular HDDs for the actual storage for the homebox server applications. From what I understand, a decent setup would be Western Digital Reds in a RAID, however you could literally use a cheapo 500GB+ HDD and you will be fine.
